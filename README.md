# Monitoring Nodes/Pods in Kubernetes and Ingress

This repository contains scripts to install Prometheus, various exporters, and Grafana. The goal is to streamline the entire processâ€”making it quick and easy to go from installation to viewing reports in Grafana about the OpenHistoricalMap infrastructure.

## Authentication for Prometheus

Before installing Prometheus, create basic authentication credentials for the Prometheus endpoint:

```sh
htpasswd -c auth prometheus-user
kubectl create secret generic prometheus-basic-auth --from-file=auth -n monitoring
```

After this step, you can proceed with Prometheus installation and configure the Ingress to use this basic authentication.

## Install prometheus and Grafana

This will install Prometheus, Grafana.


```sh
export ENVIROMENT=staging
#export ENVIROMENT=Production
./deploy.sh create
## Delete apps
./deploy.sh delete
```


## Install Dashboard

Import the file dashboard.json into Grafana.

Result:
https://prometheus.openhistoricalmap.org/
